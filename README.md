# The influence of electromagnetic radiation on action potential of a single neuron

## Overview
We assess the effect of electromagnetic radiation by means of electromagnetic induction on action potential dynamics using the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model.
The fluctuation or changes in neuron dynamics are well-known response to magnetic field. 
Most often, the magnetic field source is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) device which operates at extremely high magnetic flux density and is used in therapeutic purposes (treatment of neurophysiological disorders and other neural degenerations).
Once the magnetic field penetrates the cell cortex, the elctric field is generated, which further causes the generation of electrovital current through a neuron's axon.
Since additional current is now applied, ion pumps are amplified (or weakened) and the membrane potential is changed -- action potential dynamics is changed, which will lead to a change in neuronal activity or, in the big picture, to a change of the complete brain metabolism.
Also, the effect of temperature on neuronal activity is observed given simple analytical formula.

## Run the experiments
Go to `src` directory using MATLAB (version R2020a/b recommended), enter `run.m` script and change the input data if necessary.
Run the `run.m` script through `Command Window` in MATLAB.
Simulation data is stored in `output/data` directory and figures in .fig format are stored in `output/figures` directory.
